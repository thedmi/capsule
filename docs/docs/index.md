# Capsule

Capsule is a .NET Standard 2.0 library and C# source generator that provides thread-safe object encapsulation.

It turns ordinary objects into thread-safe *capsules*. A capsule can be used *concurrently* without the risk of race conditions. The original interface is retained, so this is *transparent* for callers.
