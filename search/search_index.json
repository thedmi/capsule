A capsule can be used concurrently without the risk of race conditions. The original interface is retained, so this is transparent for callers.</p> <p></p> <p>To create a capsule, you provide an implementation (green) and specify how the methods and properties (yellow) are to be encapsulated. Capsule then adds synchronization infrastructure (blue) and the hull (red), a generated interface adapter.</p> <p>Apart from a few attributes and the requirement to make methods <code>async</code>, implementations remain free of synchronization code.

It also improves testability because synchronization concerns are separated.</p>"},{"location":"10_quickstart/","title":"Quick Start","text":"<p>First, install the  and  Nuget packages.</p> <p>Now define a capsule implementation that you want to wrap in a thread-safe way:</p> <pre><code>[Capsule]\npublic class MemoryCache\n{\n    private readonly Dictionary&lt;int, Entry&gt; _cacheEntries = new();\n\n    [Expose]\n    public async Task InsertOrUpdateAsync(int key, string content)\n    {\n        _cacheEntries[key] = new Entry(DateTime.UtcNow, content);\n    }\n\n    [Expose]\n    public async Task&lt;string?&gt; GetAsync(int key)\n    {\n        return _cacheEntries.GetValueOrDefault(key)?.Content;\n    }\n\n    private record Entry(DateTime Timestamp, string Content);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This is a simple example of an in-memory cache. It is so simple that it could have been implemented with ordinary locks or a concurrent dictionary. We'll do it with Capsule anyway for the sake of this example.</p> <p>The dictionary in <code>MemoryCache</code> is mutable state that must not be accessed concurrently. Capsule turns <code>MemoryCache</code> into a capsule by finding the <code>[Capsule]</code> attribute and wrapping the class in a thread-safe hull with an interface that matches the <code>[Expose]</code> attributed methods. This can then be used in concurrent contexts, e.g. in an ASP.NET Core controller:</p> <pre><code>[Controller]\npublic class SampleController(IMemoryCache cache)\n{\n    [HttpGet]\n    public async Task&lt;string?&gt; GetAsync(int key) =&gt; await cache.GetAsync(key);\n\n    [HttpPut]\n    public async Task InsertOrUpdateAsync(int key, string content) =&gt; \n        await cache.InsertOrUpdateAsync(key, content);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note the usage of <code>IMemoryCache</code> (capsule interface) instead of <code>MemoryCache</code>. The former is backed by the thread-safe hull, the latter is the non-thread-safe implementation.</p> <p>As you can see, the only thing we need to make the implementation thread-safe are the <code>[Capsule]</code> and <code>[Expose]</code> attributes. Neither locks nor concurrent collections (that are hard to use correctly) are needed.</p> <p>Typically, you'll register the capsule in DI. Capsule comes with support for Microsoft dependency injection, which is included in the <code>Capsule.Core</code> nuget package:</p> <pre><code>services.AddCapsuleHost();\n\nservices.AddSingleton&lt;IMemoryCache&gt;(\n    p =&gt; new MemoryCache(TimeSpan.FromDays(1))\n        .Encapsulate(p.GetRequiredService&lt;CapsuleRuntimeContext&gt;()));\n</code></pre> <p>The first line registers Capsule infrastructure. The second line instantiates <code>MemoryCache</code> and wraps it in the thread-safe hull using <code>Encapsulate()</code>. The result is then registered as <code>IMemoryCache</code>.</p>"},{"location":"20_motivation/","title":"Motivation","text":"<p>Writing thread-safe code is hard. .NET offers a lot of powerful synchronization primitives and helper classes, but using them in complex problem domains often leads to a lot of boilerplate, lower readability, reduced testability and consequently a higher risk for bugs.</p> <p>Capsule aims to improve the situation through the following approaches:</p> <ul> <li>Provide generic thread-safe synchronization that allows for different synchronization modes such as \"await result\" or \"fire and forget\"</li> <li>Ensure usage of thread-safe objects follows an object-oriented approach that integrates seamlessly with ordinary code</li> <li>Generate boilerplate instead of making library users maintain it themselves</li> </ul> <p>To achieve this, Capsule employs well-known synchronization primitives such as <code>Channel&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>TaskCompletionSource</code> and a purpose-built source generator.</p>"},{"location":"30_usage/","title":"Usage","text":""},{"location":"30_usage/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>Capsule is shipped as a set of Nuget packages:</p> <ul> <li> Core functionality such as invocation loop and synchronizer implementations.
